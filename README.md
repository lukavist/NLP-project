# NLP Project

## Overview
This project explores a variety of foundational and applied topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including dialogue systems, ethical considerations, language modeling, parsing, and speech synthesis.

---

## 1. Chatbots & Finite-State Automata (FSA)

**Goal:**  
Design a finite-state automaton to simulate a basic customer service chatbot.

**Example Project Idea:**  
A dialogue manager for an ATM system that helps customers check their balance and withdraw money.

**Deliverables:**
- FSA diagram or implementation
- Sample dialogue flow
- Explanation of states and transitions

---

## 2. Ethical Considerations in NLP

**Goal:**  
Write a brief critical report discussing the ethical issues involved in NLP applications.

**Suggested Topics:**
- Bias in language models
- Privacy concerns in speech/text data
- Ethical use of chatbots and AI-generated content

**Deliverable:**
- A short written report (approx. 1-2 pages)

---

## 3. N-gram Language Models

**Goal:**  
Develop and evaluate a simple n-gram language model for unigram (n=1), bigram (n=2), and trigram (n=3) configurations.

**Tasks:**
- Tokenize and preprocess a text dataset
- Calculate n-gram probabilities
- Evaluate model performance (e.g., perplexity)

**Deliverables:**
- Source code
- Sample output
- Short analysis of results

---

## 4. Text Parsing

**Goal:**  
Develop a basic text parser that analyzes sentence structure.

**Suggestions:**
- Use regular expressions or parsing libraries
- Perform syntactic analysis (e.g., POS tagging, constituency parsing)

**Deliverables:**
- Parser implementation
- Example inputs and outputs
- Brief evaluation or discussion

---

## 5. Speech Synthesis

**Goal:**  
Experiment with speech synthesis tools and report on the experience.

**Suggested Tools:**
- [Cepstral Demo](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos)
- [CMU Festival Voice Demos](http://festvox.org/voicedemos.html)

**Deliverables:**
- Audio samples (if possible)
- A short report discussing tool usability, quality, and applications
